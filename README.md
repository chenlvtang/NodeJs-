## 0x02 Difficulty

<small>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ IS THE HARDEST</small>

chall_4: ⭐⭐ （easy. U don't have to care about the error when u view the index , just try to hack.）

8-bit pub: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (I didn't do it. Because it needs Mysql && SMTP && Linux, why don't there are a Dockerfile. SAD....)

hardjs: (The origin Dockerfile had some problems, which wasted me a lot of time. I deleted the aliyun mirrors, and changed the mysql to mariadb, and it finally work.  But it still failed in the Ubuntu, when i ran it in Kali, ohhhhh, Success. )
